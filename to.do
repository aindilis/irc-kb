(do social network analysis)

(start logging information about irc channels in irc-kb, such as
 whether neophytes are generally welcome, etc)

(completed
 (2019-07-09 04:37:57 <aindilis> I should highlight irc
  usernames differently if there's an IRC-KB entry for them ))

(have it so that it recognizes from the logs when we are having a
 2-way or n-way conversation involving someone else, so that we
 can quickly grep for what we've discussed with other people
 versus all the discussions not including us involving that
 person)

(2019-05-17 08:15:13 <aindilis> okay so I am going to add to my IRC-KB project
 to compute a measure of channel activity
 2019-05-17 08:15:44 <aindilis> from log parses, in addition to social network
 analysis (in order to make sure there are many people and not just a few
	   talking on the channels)
 )

(track who knows Prolog, who wants to work on AI)
(infer interests and stuff from channel information)

(?possibly? compute what they find interesting if they routinely
 capitalize certain words and don't capitalize others)

(extract commitments from text using IE)
